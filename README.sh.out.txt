_ Usage _
[0;37;100m[0;34m ./_consolidate_documents.bat [0m[0m

Some larger binary replacement documents (ie. some PDF files) may be written to &#39;_bundle/&#39; to avoid unintentionally adding large binary object output to git history. Move these files to the root of the repository when appropriate.

_ Design _

Mostly uses &#39;_unite_with_bookmarks&#39; functions . List of files to consolidate is configured with &#39;ops.sh&#39; override of &#39;_consolidate_documents&#39;.

_ Safety _

Safety notices may be included with the consolidated documents. See those for details.

_ Reference _
 

_ ACKNOWLEDGEMENT - Repository History _

In addition to any stated acknowledgements in the documents here, which may cite contributors or other works, the repository history may also acknowledge authors, contributors, and other works. Normally, explicit citations will nevertheless be added to documents here under an &#39;acknowledgement&#39; or similar heading, unless the documents are of narrow, small, non-research, and/or similar purpose for which such would not be usual apparent practice (eg. a &#39;resume&#39;).
